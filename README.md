Userscript for [Niantic Wayfarer](http://wayfarer.nianticlabs.com/)

## Installation

Wayfarer-Tools is tested with Chrome and Firefox. You need a userscript manager like [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) (You already have one if you use IITC for Ingress). Wayfarer-Tools does not work with Greasemonkey for Firefox.

####âš ðŸ›  We're working on Wayfarer compatibility. You can download a test-version [here](https://gitlab.com/1110101/opr-tools/raw/feature/wayfarerSupport/opr-tools.user.js?inline=false).


## Features:
- Additional links to map services like Intel, OpenStreetMap, bing and national ones
- Create your own presets for frequent analyses. Wayfarer-tools does not include any presets in order to remain neutral.
- Automatically opens the first listed possible duplicate and the "What is it?" filter text box
- Buttons above the comments box to auto-type common 1-star rejection reasons
- Percent of total reviewed candidates processed
- Translate text buttons for title and description
- Moved overall portal rating to same group as other ratings
- Changed portal markers to small circles, inspired by IITC style
- Made "Nearby portals" list and map scrollable with mouse wheel
- Refresh page if no portal analysis available
- Displays a 20m and 40m capture circle around the candidates location
- Expiration timer in navigation bar
- **Keyboard navigation**
